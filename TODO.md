# TODO

* in insert mode when there is a cmp item: how to create newline?
  * use something else for cmp (only pick with <C-p>?)
  * use <S-cr> for forcing a newline (this sucks...)
* take twig integration from kickstart.nvim IF that is good
* tailwindcss https://www.lazyvim.org/extras/lang/tailwind
